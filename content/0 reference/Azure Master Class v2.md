# Azure Master Class v2 - Module 2 - Identity

## Introduction to Azure Identity and Access Management

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of Azure's identity and access management solutions, focusing on Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and related services. It covers key concepts, features, and best practices for implementing secure and efficient identity management in Azure cloud environments.

## Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

### Overview
Azure AD is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service, serving as the foundation for securing access to Azure resources, Microsoft 365, and third-party applications.

### Key Components
- **Users**: Represent individuals within the organization
- **Groups**: Collections of users for easier management
- **Applications**: Registered apps that integrate with Azure AD
- **Devices**: Endpoints that can be registered or joined to Azure AD

### Features
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enables users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification
- **Conditional Access**: Allows granular control over access to resources based on various factors
- **Identity Protection**: Uses machine learning to detect and prevent identity-based risks

### Azure AD Editions
- **Free**: Basic directory services and user management
- **Office 365 Apps**: Tailored for Office 365 users

### Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigns permissions to users, groups, or applications
- **Administrative Units**: Allows delegation of administrative tasks for specific groups of users or resources

### Best Practices
- Implement **least privilege** access principles
- Use **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** for just-in-time access to elevated roles
- Regularly perform **access reviews** to ensure appropriate permissions

```mermaid

    C --> H[Windows Hello for Business]
    C --> I[FIDO2 Keys]
    C --> J[Microsoft Authenticator]
```

## Conditional Access and Identity Protection

### Conditional Access
- **Policies**: Define rules for allowing or blocking access based on various signals
- **Signals**: User, device, location, application, and real-time risk detection
- **Access Controls**: Require MFA, compliant devices, or specific locations for access

### Identity Protection
- **Risk Detection**: Uses machine learning to identify potentially compromised identities
- **Risk Remediation**: Automated actions to mitigate detected risks
- **Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on risky users and sign-ins

### Best Practices

# Azure Master Class v2 - Module 10 - Monitoring & Security

## Azure Monitoring

### Introduction
Azure Monitoring is a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from Azure and on-premises environments. It helps ensure high availability and performance of applications and services.

### Key Components

1. **Azure Monitor**: The core platform for all monitoring data
2. **Log Analytics**: A tool for querying and analyzing log data
3. **Application Insights**: Application Performance Management (APM) service
4. **Metrics**: Time-series database for storing numerical data
5. **Diagnostic Settings**: Configuration for routing platform logs and metrics

### Technical Details

- **Data Sources**:
  - Activity Log: Subscription-level events
  - Resource Logs: Resource-level diagnostic information
  - Guest OS: Data from within VMs or other compute resources
  - Application: Custom application telemetry

- **Data Types**:
  - Metrics: Numerical values stored in a time-series database
  - Logs: Text-based data stored in Log Analytics

- **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)**: Latest agent for collecting monitoring data, replacing older agents like Log Analytics agent and Telegraf

- **Data Collection Rules (DCRs)**: Define what data to collect and where to send it

### Best Practices

- Implement a comprehensive monitoring strategy across all resources
- Use Azure Policy to enforce consistent monitoring configuration
- Leverage Auto-scaling based on monitoring data
- Implement proper retention policies to manage costs

## Azure Security

### Introduction
Azure Security is a multi-layered approach to protect cloud resources, data, and applications. It encompasses various services and best practices to ensure a secure cloud environment.

### Key Components

1. **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)
2. **Azure Active Directory (AD)**: Identity and access management service
3. **Azure Key Vault**: Secure storage for secrets, keys, and certificates
4. **Azure Firewall**: Cloud-native firewall as a service
5. **Azure Sentinel**: Cloud-native SIEM and SOAR solution

### Technical Details

- **Zero Trust Model**: 
  - Verify explicitly
  - Use least privilege access
  - Assume breach

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**:
  - Free tier: Basic CSPM features
  - Paid tier: Advanced threat protection for various Azure services

- **Managed Identities**:
  - System-assigned: Tied to a specific Azure resource
  - User-assigned: Can be shared across multiple resources

- **Azure Key Vault**:
  - Supports secrets, keys, and certificates
  - Integrates with Azure AD for access control
  - Offers automated rotation for keys and secrets

### Best Practices

- Implement the principle of least privilege
- Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all accounts
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Regularly review and update security policies
- Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) VM access

## Azure Alerting and Action Groups

### Introduction
Azure Alerting helps proactively notify administrators about important events or conditions in the Azure environment. Action Groups define a set of actions to take when an alert is triggered.

### Key Components

1. **Alert Rules**: Define conditions that trigger alerts
2. **Action Groups**: Specify actions to take when alerts fire
3. **Alert Processing Rules**: Control how alerts are handled

### Technical Details

- **Alert Types**:
  - Metric Alerts: Based on resource performance metrics
  - Log Alerts: Based on Log Analytics queries
  - Activity Log Alerts: Based on Azure subscription events

- **Action Types**:
  - Email, SMS, Push notifications
  - Azure Functions
  - Logic Apps
  - Webhook
  - ITSM connection

- **Alert Processing Rules**:
  - Apply actions to multiple alerts
  - Suppress alerts during maintenance windows

### Best Practices

- Use dynamic thresholds for metric alerts where possible
- Implement proper alert severity levels
- Use Action Groups for consistent alert handling
- Regularly review and optimize alert configurations
