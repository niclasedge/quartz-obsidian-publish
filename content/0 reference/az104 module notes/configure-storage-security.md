# Azure Storage Security: Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Security Strategies

### Encryption
- At-rest: Automatic 256-bit AES encryption for all data
- In-transit: TLS 1.2 for data transfer

### Authentication
- Microsoft Entra ID integration
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for fine-grained permissions
- Support for OAuth 2.0

### Data in transit security
- Client-Side Encryption: Encrypt data before sending to Azure
- HTTPS: Secure communication channel
- SMB 3.0: Encrypted file transfers for Azure Files

### Disk encryption
- Azure Disk Encryption: BitLocker for Windows VMs, dm-crypt for Linux VMs
- Encrypts OS and data disks

### Shared Access Signatures (SAS)
- Delegated, time-limited access to resources
- Three types: User delegation, Service, Account

### Authorization methods
1. Microsoft Entra ID: Cloud-based identity service
2. Shared Key: Account-specific access keys
3. SAS: Granular, time-bound access
4. Anonymous access: Public read access for containers/blobs

## 2. Shared Access Signatures (SAS) in Detail

### Types
1. User delegation SAS: Secured with Microsoft Entra credentials
2. Service SAS: Access to specific storage service
3. Account SAS: Access to one or more storage services

### Configuration parameters
- Signing method: Account key or User delegation key
- Signing key: Primary or secondary account key
- Permissions: Read, Write, Delete, List, Add, Create, Update, Process
- Start/Expiry time: Validity period
- IP range: Restrict to specific IP addresses
- Protocols: HTTPS-only or HTTPS and HTTP

### URI format and parameters
```
https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/?restype=service&comp=properties
&sv=2015-04-05&ss=bf&srt=sco&st=2015-04-29T22%3A18%3A26Z
&se=2015-04-30T02%3A23%3A26Z&sr=b&sp=rw
&sip=168.1.5.60-168.1.5.70&spr=https,http
&sig=F%6GRVAZ5Cdj2Pw4tgU7IlSTkWgn7bUkkAg8P6HESXwmf%4B
```
- sv: Storage version
- ss: Storage service (b=blob, f=file, q=queue, t=table)
- srt: Resource type (s=service, c=container, o=object)
- st/se: Start time/Expiry time
- sr: Storage resource (b=blob, c=container, f=file, s=share)
- sp: Permissions
- sip: IP range
- spr: Allowed protocols
- sig: Signature

## 3. Azure Storage Encryption

### Microsoft-managed keys
- Default option
- Automatic key management
- No configuration required

### Customer-managed keys
- Use Azure Key Vault to store keys
- Supports key rotation and auditing
- Configuration steps:
  1. Create a Key Vault
  2. Generate/import encryption key
  3. Configure storage account to use the key
  4. Enable automatic key rotation (optional)

## 4. Best Practices

### SAS security
- Always use HTTPS
- Use stored access policies for service SAS
- Set short expiration times
- Require clients to renew SAS near expiration
- Be careful with SAS start time (consider clock skew)
- Minimize SAS permissions
- Understand billing implications of SAS usage
- Validate data written through SAS

### General security
- Enable Secure transfer required option
- Implement network security rules
- Use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication when possible
- Implement least privilege access
- Use soft delete and blob versioning for data protection
- Regularly rotate storage account keys
- Use customer-managed keys for added control

## 5. Implementation Steps

1. Plan security strategy
   - Identify sensitive data
   - Determine access patterns
   - Choose appropriate security mechanisms

2. Configure encryption
   - Decide between Microsoft-managed or customer-managed keys
   - If using customer-managed keys, set up Azure Key Vault

3. Set up authentication
   - Configure Microsoft Entra ID integration
   - Set up RBAC roles
   - Create service principals for application access

4. Implement authorization
   - Define SAS policies
   - Create stored access policies
   - Configure IP and protocol restrictions

5. Manage SAS tokens
   - Generate SAS tokens as needed
   - Implement SAS rotation mechanism
   - Set up monitoring for SAS usage

6. Apply network security
   - Configure firewalls and virtual networks
   - Set up private endpoints if needed
   - Implement service endpoints for added security

7. Regular maintenance
   - Rotate storage account keys
   - Review and update access policies
   - Monitor and audit access patterns

## 6. Monitoring and Maintenance

### Azure Storage Analytics
- Enable logging for read, write, and delete requests
- Set up metrics for availability, ingress/egress, latency, and success percentage
- Use Azure Monitor for alerting on anomalies

### Auditing
- Regularly review access logs
- Use Azure Policy for compliance monitoring
- Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) access for administrative tasks

### Key and SAS management
- Rotate storage account keys at least every 90 days
- Use Azure Key Vault for secure key storage and rotation
- Implement automated processes for SAS renewal and revocation
