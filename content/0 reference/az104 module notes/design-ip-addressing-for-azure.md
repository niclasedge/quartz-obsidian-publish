Certainly! I'll expand on the key sections while still aiming for conciseness:

# Comprehensive Guide: IP Addressing and Network Integration in Azure

## 1. Introduction

Scenario: A manufacturing company is migrating services to Azure cloud
- Need to integrate existing on-premises network with Azure
- Careful planning of public and private IP addresses required
- Goals: Flexibility, room for growth, and seamless on-premises integration

Key Objectives:
1. Understand Azure's public and private IP addressing capabilities
2. Identify requirements for IP addressing when integrating with on-premises networks
3. Design and implement virtual networks with appropriate IP schemes

## 2. Azure IP Addressing in Depth

### 2.1 Public IP Addresses

Types:
1. Dynamic
   - Can change over resource lifespan
   - Released when VM is stopped/deallocated
2. Static
   - Remains constant throughout resource lifespan
   - Assigned immediately upon creation

SKUs:
1. Basic
   - Can be dynamic or static
   - Open by default (NSGs recommended but optional)
   - No zone redundancy
2. Standard
   - Always static allocation
   - Closed to inbound traffic by default (requires NSG)
   - Zone-redundant
   - Supports routing preference

Public IP Address Prefix:
- Reserved, static range of public IP addresses
- Can be zone-redundant or zone-specific
- Simplifies firewall rules management
- Prefix size determines number of available addresses

### 2.2 Private IP Addresses

Usage: Internal communication within Azure Virtual Network and connected on-premises networks

Types:
1. Dynamic
   - Assigned via DHCP lease
   - Can change over resource lifespan
2. Static
   - Assigned via DHCP reservation
   - Remains constant throughout resource lifespan

### 2.3 Virtual Network IP Addressing

Address Spaces:
- 10.0.0.0/8
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

Subnetting:
- Divide VNet into multiple subnets
- Each subnet must have a unique CIDR range
- First three IP addresses reserved by Azure
- Formula for usable addresses: (2^n)-5, where n is number of host bits

## 3. Planning IP Addressing

### 3.1 Requirements Gathering

Key Questions:
1. Current and projected device count?
2. Required number of subnets?
3. Devices per subnet (current and future)?
4. Subnet size variations?
5. Services requiring isolation?

Considerations:
- Growth projections
- Security requirements
- Service dependencies

### 3.2 CIDR and Subnet Calculations

CIDR Basics:
- Allows flexible IP allocation
- Format: IP address/prefix length (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
- Prefix length determines network vs. host portion

Subnet Size Calculation:
- Available addresses = (2^n)-5
- Example: /24 subnet
  * 2^8 = 256
  * 256 - 5 = 251 usable addresses

## 4. Implementing Virtual Networks (Detailed Exercise)

### 4.1 CoreServicesVnet (West US)

Purpose: Main operational network with on-premises connectivity

Address space: 10.20.0.0/16

Subnets:
1. GatewaySubnet (10.20.0.0/27)
   - For VPN gateway
   - Minimum /27 size recommended
2. SharedServicesSubnet (10.20.10.0/24)
   - For domain controllers, DNS
3. DatabaseSubnet (10.20.20.0/24)
   - Isolated subnet for database servers
4. PublicWebServiceSubnet (10.20.30.0/24)
   - For web servers with public access

Implementation (Azure CLI):
```bash
az network vnet create --resource-group "<RG>" --name CoreServicesVnet --address-prefixes 10.20.0.0/16 --location westus

az network vnet subnet create --resource-group "<RG>" --vnet-name CoreServicesVnet --name GatewaySubnet --address-prefixes 10.20.0.0/27

# Repeat for other subnets
```

### 4.2 ManufacturingVnet (North Europe)

Purpose: Network for manufacturing operations and IoT devices

Address space: 10.30.0.0/16

Subnets:
1. ManufacturingSystemSubnet (10.30.10.0/24)
   - For core manufacturing systems
2. SensorSubnet1 (10.30.20.0/24)
3. SensorSubnet2 (10.30.21.0/24)
4. SensorSubnet3 (10.30.22.0/24)
   - Multiple subnets for different types or locations of sensors

Implementation (Azure CLI):
```bash
az network vnet create --resource-group "<RG>" --name ManufacturingVnet --address-prefixes 10.30.0.0/16 --location northeurope

az network vnet subnet create --resource-group "<RG>" --vnet-name ManufacturingVnet --name ManufacturingSystemSubnet --address-prefixes 10.30.10.0/24

# Repeat for sensor subnets
```

### 4.3 ResearchVnet (West India)

Purpose: Small, stable network for R&D team

Address space: 10.40.40.0/24

Subnet:
1. ResearchSystemSubnet (10.40.40.0/24)
   - Single subnet for all R&D resources

Implementation (Azure CLI):
```bash
az network vnet create --resource-group "<RG>" --name ResearchVnet --address-prefixes 10.40.40.0/24 --location westindia

az network vnet subnet create --resource-group "<RG>" --vnet-name ResearchVnet --name ResearchSystemSubnet --address-prefixes 10.40.40.0/24
```

## 5. Best Practices and Advanced Configurations

1. Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) for subnet-level security
2. Implement Azure Bastion for secure VM access
3. Set up VNet peering for inter-VNet communication
