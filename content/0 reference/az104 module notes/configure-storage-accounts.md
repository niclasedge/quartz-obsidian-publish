# Azure Storage: Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Introduction
- Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data scenarios
- Massively scalable object store with high durability and availability
- Supports REST API, SDKs for multiple languages, and Azure PowerShell/CLI

## 2. Storage Types
1. Blob Storage: 
   - Unstructured data (text, binary)
   - Three types: Block blobs, Append blobs, Page blobs
   - Use cases: Images, videos, backups, big data analytics

2. Files: 
   - Managed file shares
   - Supports SMB and NFS protocols
   - Use cases: Lift-and-shift migrations, shared application settings

3. Queue Storage: 
   - Messaging between app components
   - Up to 64 KB per message, millions of messages per queue
   - Use cases: Async processing, decoupling application components

4. Table Storage: 
   - NoSQL structured data
   - Schemaless design for flexible data storage
   - Use cases: Address books, device information, metadata storage

## 3. Storage Account Types
- Standard general-purpose v2: 
  - Most scenarios, all storage services
  - HDD-based storage
- Premium block blobs: 
  - High transaction rates, smaller objects
  - SSD-based storage, low latency
- Premium file shares: 
  - Enterprise applications, high-performance workloads
  - SSD-based storage, supports both SMB and NFS
- Premium page blobs: 
  - OS disks, databases
  - SSD-based storage, designed for frequent read/write operations

## 4. Replication Strategies
- Locally redundant storage (LRS):
  - 3 copies in single data center
  - Lowest cost, least durability
- Zone redundant storage (ZRS):
  - 3 copies across availability zones in one region
  - High availability, protects against data center failures
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS):
  - 6 copies: 3 in primary region, 3 in secondary region
  - Protects against regional outages
- Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS):
  - Combines ZRS in primary region with GRS
  - Highest durability and availability

## 5. Access & Security
- Unique URL for each object: https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<blob>
- Custom domain configuration:
  - Direct mapping with CNAME record
  - Intermediary domain mapping with 'asverify' subdomain
- Service endpoints:
  - Restrict access to specific virtual networks
  - Available for all Azure Storage services
- Firewalls and virtual networks:
  - Restrict access by IP address ranges
  - Allow access from specific subnets or virtual networks
- Encryption:
  - Data at rest: Always encrypted using Storage Service Encryption (SSE)
  - Data in transit: Secure transfer can be enforced (HTTPS only)

## 6. Key Features
- Durability and availability: Up to 16 9's of durability with GZRS
- Secure access: 
  - Azure Active Directory integration
  - Shared Access Signatures (SAS) for delegated access
- Scalability: Up to 5 PB for single storage account
- Manageability: 
  - Azure Portal, Azure Storage Explorer
  - PowerShell, Azure CLI, REST API
- Accessibility: 
  - SDKs for .NET, Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, PHP, Ruby
  - REST API for platform-agnostic access

## 7. Implementation Steps
1. Choose storage account type based on performance needs and data type
2. Select replication strategy considering durability, availability, and cost
3. Configure access and security:
   - Set up firewalls and virtual networks
   - Configure authentication method (Azure AD, Shared Key, SAS)
4. Set up custom domain (if needed):
   - Create CNAME record in DNS
   - Validate domain ownership in Azure Portal
5. Implement service endpoints:
   - Enable on VNet and subnet
   - Add VNet to storage account firewall settings

## 8. Best Practices
- Use appropriate storage type for data characteristics
- Implement least-privilege access using Azure RBAC
- Enable soft delete for data protection (recovery from accidental deletion)
- Monitor and optimize performance:
  - Use Azure Monitor metrics
  - Implement retry logic in applications
- Use lifecycle management for cost optimization:
  - Automatically tier data to cool/archive storage
  - Set up automatic deletion policies for unnecessary data
