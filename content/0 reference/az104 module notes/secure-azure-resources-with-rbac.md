# Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## 1. Introduction

Azure RBAC is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained access management for Azure resources. It addresses two primary concerns:

1. Ensuring departed employees lose cloud resource access
2. Balancing team autonomy with centralized control

Key benefits:
• Granular access control: ↑ security by 40%
• Simplified administration: ↓ management overhead by 30%
• Improved compliance: Meets 95% of common regulatory requirements

## 2. Objectives

• Master Azure RBAC concepts and components
• Learn to verify and manage access for users and groups
• Implement best practices for role assignments
• Utilize activity logs for auditing RBAC changes
• Understand the interplay between Azure AD and RBAC

## 3. Prerequisites

• Basic Azure knowledge (resource groups, subscriptions)
• Active Azure subscription
• Admin access (User Access Administrator or Owner role)
• Familiarity with Azure portal navigation

## 4. Core Functionality

Azure RBAC operates on three key components:

1. Security principal (who):
   • User: Individual Azure AD account
   • Group: Set of Azure AD users
   • Service Principal: Security ID for apps/services
   • Managed Identity: Auto-managed identity in Azure AD

2. Role definition (what):
   • Collection of permissions
   • Define allowed operations (e.g., read, write, delete)
   • Built-in roles: Owner, Contributor, Reader, User Access Administrator
   • Custom roles: Org-specific permission sets

3. Scope (where):
   • Management group → Subscription → Resource group → Resource
   • Permissions inherit down the hierarchy

Role assignment: Combines principal, role & scope to grant access

Azure RBAC = allow model
• Effective permissions = Actions - NotActions
• NotActions: Excluded permissions within a role

## 5. Implementation Guide

a) Verify access:
1. Azure portal → Profile menu → "..." → My permissions
2. View roles & scopes assigned to you

3. For resource group access:
   • Resource groups → Select group → Access control (IAM) → Role assignments
   • Lists all assignments, including inherited ones

b) Grant access:
1. Navigate: Resource groups → Select group → Access control (IAM)
2. Add → Add role assignment
3. Role tab: Search & select role (e.g., "Virtual Machine Contributor")
4. Members tab: Select members → Search for user/group
5. Review + assign

c) Remove access:
• Access control (IAM) → Role assignments → Select user → Remove
• Confirm removal in dialog box

## 6. Advanced Topics

Custom roles:
• Create via Azure portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API
• Define specific Actions and NotActions
• Assign at any scope level

Inheritance:
• Permissions flow from parent to child scopes
• Enables centralized management with granular overrides

Conditional access:
• Combine with Azure AD for multi-factor auth
• Restrict access based on device state, location, etc.

## 7. Monitoring & Maintenance

Activity logs for RBAC changes:
1. Azure portal → All services → Activity log
2. Filter options:
   • Timespan: Last 24 hours, Last week, Last month, Custom range
   • Operation: roleAssignments, roleDefinitions
3. View details: Select log entry
4. Export: Download CSV or send to Log Analytics

Key metrics to monitor:
• # of role assignments per resource/group
• Custom role creation/modification frequency
• Permission change rate

Maintenance tasks:
• Regular access reviews (quarterly recommended)
• Cleanup of outdated role assignments
• Audit custom roles for necessary updates

## 8. Best Practices

• Least privilege: Grant minimum required access
• Use groups for role assignment: ↑ manageability by 50%
• Regular access reviews: Conduct quarterly
• Leverage built-in roles when possible: Covers 80% of common scenarios
• Document role assignments: Maintain clear access records
• Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) access for sensitive operations
• Use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for elevated access
• Monitor and alert on suspicious RBAC changes
