# Azure Virtual Networks: Comprehensive Technical Guide

## 1. Intro

Azure VNets enable private networks in Azure for secure resource communication. Benefits:
- ↑ scalability & availability by 40%
- ↓ on-prem infrastructure costs by 25%
- Secure connection to on-prem (hybrid cloud)

## 2. Objectives

1. Understand VNet features & components
2. Implement subnets effectively
3. Assign IP addresses (public/private)
4. Create & configure VNets

## 3. Prerequisites

- Basic cloud networking knowledge
- IP addressing & subnetting familiarity

## 4. Core Functionality

VNets:
- Logical isolation of Azure resources
- Own CIDR block
- Linkable to other VNets/on-prem
- Customizable DNS & subnets

Key components:
1. Subnets
2. IP addressing (public/private)
3. Network Security Groups (NSGs)
4. Virtual Network Gateways

## 5. Implementation Guide

1. Plan address space (non-overlapping)
2. Create VNet in Azure portal
3. Define subnets
4. Configure DNS settings
5. Set up NSGs
6. (Optional) Connect to on-prem

Best practices:
- Use meaningful naming conventions
- Plan for future growth
- Implement least-privilege access

## 6. Advanced Topics

1. Peering VNets
2. Service endpoints
3. Private Link
4. Network virtual appliances (NVAs)

## 7. Monitoring & Maintenance

Key metrics:
- Bandwidth usage
- Connection status
- Latency

Maintenance:
1. Regular security audits
2. Update NSG rules
3. Monitor IP address utilization

Troubleshooting:
- Use Network Watcher
- Check NSG flow logs
- Verify routing tables

## 8. Best Practices

1. Encrypt data in transit
2. Use Azure Bastion for secure VM access
3. Implement Azure Firewall
4. Regularly review & update network designs
