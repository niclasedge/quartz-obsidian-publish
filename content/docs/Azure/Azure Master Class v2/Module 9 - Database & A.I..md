## Types of Data Structures

### Introduction
This section covers the various data structures used in Azure databases, including relational and non-relational models.

### Key Points
- **Relational Data**: Structured data following a schema, typically used for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
- **Non-Relational Data**: Flexible data structures, often referred to as NoSQL databases
- **Unstructured Data**: Raw data without a predefined schema, such as media files or documents

### Technical Details
1. Relational Data:
   - Uses tables with defined schemas
   - Normalizes data to reduce redundancy
   - Supports ACID transactions
   - Examples: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL

2. Non-Relational Data:
   - Document databases (e.g., JSON, XML)
   - Key-value stores
   - Columnar databases
   - Graph databases

3. Unstructured Data:
   - Binary Large Objects (BLOBs)
   - Media files (JPEG, MP4, etc.)
   - Text documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

### Best Practices
- Choose the appropriate data structure based on the application's requirements
- Consider scalability and performance needs when selecting a data model
- Use relational databases for complex transactions and data integrity
- Leverage non-relational databases for flexibility and scalability in big data scenarios
