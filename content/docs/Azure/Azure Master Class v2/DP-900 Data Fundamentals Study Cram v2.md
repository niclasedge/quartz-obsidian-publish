## 4. Core Functionality

### 4.1 Containers

Containers virtualize the operating system, providing isolated user spaces while sharing the kernel. This approach offers significant advantages over traditional virtual machines.

#### 4.1.1 Container vs VM Architecture


```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Virtual Machine"
        H1[Hardware]
        HV[Hypervisor]
        subgraph VM1[VM 1]
            G1[Guest OS]
            B1[Bins/Libs]
            A1[App 1]
        end
        subgraph VM2[VM 2]
            G2[Guest OS]
            B2[Bins/Libs]
            A2[App 2]
        end
    end

    subgraph "Container"
        H2[Hardware]
        HOS[Host OS]
        CR[Container Runtime]
        subgraph C1[Container 1]
            B3[Bins/Libs]
            A3[App 1]
        end
        subgraph C2[Container 2]
            B4[Bins/Libs]
            A4[App 2]
        end
    end
```

Key components:
1. Container Runtime: Software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O)
2. Container Images: Lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run an application
3. Namespaces: Provide isolation for processes, network, and filesystem
4. Control Groups (cgroups): Limit and isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.)

#### 4.1.2 Container Image Layers

Container images are built using a layered approach, which allows for efficient storage and transfer.

```mermaid
graph TD
    B[Base OS Layer]
    R[Runtime Layer]
    D[Dependencies Layer]
    A[Application Code Layer]
    C[Configuration Layer]

    B --> R
    R --> D
    D --> A
    A --> C

```

#### 4.1.3 Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### 4.2 Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

#### 4.2.1 Kubernetes Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Control Plane"
        API[API Server]
        S[Scheduler]
        CM[Controller Manager]
        ETCD[etcd]
    end

    subgraph "Node 1"
        K1[Kubelet]
        P1[Pod 1]
        P2[Pod 2]
    end

    subgraph "Node 2"
        K2[Kubelet]
        P3[Pod 3]
        P4[Pod 4]
    end

    API --- S
    API --- CM
    API --- ETCD
    API --- K1
    API --- K2

```

Key components:

1. Control Plane:
   - API Server: Front-end for the Kubernetes control plane
   - Scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes
   - Controller Manager: Runs controller processes
   - etcd: Distributed key-value store for cluster state

2. Nodes:
   - Kubelet: Ensures containers are running in a pod
   - Container Runtime: Software for running containers (e.g., Docker)
   - Kube Proxy: Maintains network rules on nodes

3. Workload Resources:
   - Pods: Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
   - Deployments: Manage ReplicaSets and provide declarative updates to Pods
   - StatefulSets: Manage stateful applications
   - DaemonSets: Ensure all (or some) nodes run a copy of a Pod

4. Services & Networking:
   - Services: Abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods
   - Ingress: Manages external access to services
   - Network Policies: Define how groups of pods are allowed to communicate

5. Storage:
   - Persistent Volumes: Piece of storage in the cluster
   - Persistent Volume Claims: Request for storage by a user
   - Storage Classes: Describe the "classes" of storage

## 5. Implementation Guide

### 5.1 Container Setup

1. Install Docker:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
   ```

2. Create a Dockerfile for your application (see example in 4.1.3)

3. Build the container image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp:v1 .
   ```

4. Push the image to a container registry:
   ```bash
   docker push myregistry.azurecr.io/myapp:v1
   ```

### 5.2 Kubernetes Cluster Setup

1. Choose a Kubernetes distribution (e.g., AKS, EKS, GKE, or self-hosted)

2. For AKS:
   ```bash
   az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 2 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys
   ```

3. Configure `kubectl`:
   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
   ```

### 5.3 Application Deployment

1. Create a Kubernetes deployment manifest (YAML):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myregistry.azurecr.io/myapp:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

2. Apply the manifest:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f myapp-deployment.yaml
   ```

3. Create a service to expose the application:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

4. Apply the service manifest:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f myapp-service.yaml
   ```

## 6. Advanced Topics

### 6.1 Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies deployment and management of applications.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[mychart/] --> B[Chart.yaml]
    A --> C[values.yaml]
    A --> D[templates/]
    D --> E[deployment.yaml]
    D --> F[service.yaml]
    D --> G[ingress.yaml]
    A --> H[charts/]
    H --> I[dependency1]
    H --> J[dependency2]

```

Example Helm install:
```bash
helm install myapp ./mychart
```

### 6.2 GitOps

GitOps is a methodology where the desired state of the Kubernetes cluster is stored in Git, and automated processes ensure the cluster state matches the repository.

```mermaid

gitGraph
   commit id: "Initial commit"
   commit id: "Add README"
   branch feature/new-feature
   checkout feature/new-feature
   commit id: "Add new feature"
   commit id: "Fix bug in new feature"
   checkout main
   merge feature/new-feature
   commit id: "Update version"
   branch hotfix/critical-bug
   checkout hotfix/critical-bug
   commit id: "Fix critical bug"
   checkout main
   merge hotfix/critical-bug
   commit id: "Release v1.0"

```

Tools:
- Flux
- ArgoCD

### 6.3 Service Mesh

A service mesh provides advanced networking features for microservices architectures.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Service A] -->|Proxy| B[Service Mesh]
    C[Service B] -->|Proxy| B
    D[Service C] -->|Proxy| B
    B -->|Traffic Management| E[Load Balancing]
    B -->|Security| F[mTLS]
    B -->|Observability| G[Tracing]

```

Popular options:
- Istio
- Linkerd
- Consul Connect

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

### 7.1 Key Metrics

- Pod health and status
- Node resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Application-specific metrics (request rate, error rate, latency)

### 7.2 Logging and Monitoring Tools

- Prometheus: Metrics collection and alerting
- Grafana: Metrics visualization
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Log aggregation and analysis
- Kubernetes Dashboard: Web-based UI for cluster management

### 7.3 Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. Pod crashes or CrashLoopBackOff errors
   - Check pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
   - Describe pod: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`

2. Node failures
   - Check node status: `kubectl get nodes`
   - Describe node: `kubectl describe node <node-name>`

3. Network connectivity problems
   - Verify service endpoints: `kubectl get endpoints`
   - Test network policies: Use tools like netshoot

4. Resource constraints (CPU, memory)

   - Adjust resource requests and limits in pod specifications

## 8. Best Practices

1. Use namespaces to organize resources and implement multi-tenancy
2. Implement resource requests and limits for all containers
3. Utilize liveness and readiness probes to ensure application health
4. Implement proper security measures:
   - Use RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
   - Implement network policies
   - Regularly update and patch Kubernetes and container images
5. Use CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
6. Implement horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) for dynamic scaling
7. Use persistent volumes and storage classes for stateful applications
