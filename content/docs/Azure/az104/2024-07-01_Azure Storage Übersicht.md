Metadata:
- Version: Azure Storage 2023
- Last Updated: July 2023
- Responsible Team: Azure Storage Team

Key Features:
- **Blob Storage**: Scalable object storage for unstructured data
- **File Storage**: Fully managed file shares accessible via SMB and NFS protocols
- **Queue Storage**: Messaging store for reliable messaging between application components
- **Table Storage**: NoSQL datastore for semi-structured data

Warnings:
- Not all features are available in all Azure regions
- Some advanced features may require higher-tier storage accounts
- Cross-region replication may have data residency implications

This diagram provides an overview of Azure Storage and its related services. It shows the main components of Azure Storage (Blob, File, Queue, and Table) and how they connect to other Azure services for enhanced functionality, security, and data management.
